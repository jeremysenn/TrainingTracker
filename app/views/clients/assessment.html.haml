    A person's body fat percentage is the total weight of the person's fat divided by the person's weight and consists of essential body
    fat and storage body fat. Essential body fat is necessary to maintain life and reproductive functions. The percentage for women is
    greater than that for men, due to the demands of childbearing and other hormonal functions. Essential fat is 3–5% in men, and 8–12% in
    women. Storage body fat consists of fat accumulation in adipose tissue, part of which protects internal organs in the chest and abdomen.

    Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to both adult men and women. Maintaining
    a healthy weight may reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Conditions associated with overweight and obesity include high blood
    pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Anyone who is overweight should work to avoid gaining additional weight. Furthermore,
    if you are overweight with other risk factors (such as high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or high blood pressure), you
    should try to lose weight. Even a small weight loss (just 10% of your current weight) may help lower the risk of disease.

    Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of daily energy expended at rest.
    The release of energy in this state is sufficient only for the functioning of the vital organs,
    the heart, lungs, nervous system, kidneys, liver, intestine, sex organs, muscles, and skin. Basal
    Metabolic Rate is usually by far the largest component of total caloric expenditure. BMR decreases with
    age generally (as people usually don't maintain lean body mass) and with the loss of lean body mass.

  %strong
    Hormone Issues (Cortisol):
  %ul
    %li
      A high umbilicus measure or high stress may indicate current or past high circulating cortisol. Chronically high levels of cortisol due
      to stress, insufficient sleep, diminished recovery, or blood sugar imbalances can increase fat mass (especially in the abdomen), decrease
      muscle mass, hamper the body's ability to handle carbohydrates, decrease sleep quality and duration, depress the immune system, and raise
      blood pressure. Too much stress and/or cortisol can promote pregnenolone steal, which decreases the body's androgens in favor of more
      cortisol production.  Abdominal fat has four times more cortisol receptors than other body fat, so the tendency is to gain fat in the
      abdominal region when chronically stressed. High levels of abdominal fat increase the risk for heart disease, promote conversion of
      testosterone to estrogen through aromatization, increase the creation of cortisol, and is associated with the metabolic syndrome.

      Water - Get plenty of water by drinking at least #{(@bodycomp.weight/2).round} ounces of water per day spread throughout.

      Multiple Meals - Focus on smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day that are high in fiber and include a complete protein,
      vegetable carbohydrate, and fat, making sure not to skip breakfast. Eat within the first hour upon awakening. Eat a small snack
      before bedtime. Eat before you become hungry.
    %li
      Sleep - Improve sleep quality and duration with the following: Eat yin producing protein sources at last meal (cottage cheese,
      swiss cheese, light/white meats, fish, shell fish). Turn lights down or off at least one hour before bed. Fiction reading
      and/or slow-paced instrumental music 30-60 minutes before bed. Make your bedroom as dark as possible (no electronic's lights or
      T.V.) or wear a night eye mask. Keep bedroom as quiet as possible or wear earplugs. Go to bed by 11pm. Shoot for at least eight
      hours of sleep per night.

      Grateful Log
    %li
      Exercise - Perform strength training and cardiovascular exercise (intervals) earlier in the day to prevent nighttime cortisol production.

      Stimulants - Coffee/caffeine in moderation, no more than two cups per day, consumed before 2pm.
    %li
      High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) - Reduce or eliminate HFCS because it can increase intra-abdominal fat, decrease insulin sensitivity, and increase cholesterol.
