Hi <%= @client.first_name %>,

I hope you're doing well and enjoying the last month of Spring.

I'm thinking of creating a product that delivers weekly, personalized workout videos directly to your phone by text message. You'd be able to choose your focus (such as leaner stomach, buff arms, bubble booty, strong back, etc.), and each day of the week you'd get a series of text-messaged exercise videos tailored to your goal.

Would you be interested in something like this? I'd love to hear what you think.

Talk to you soon.
